Places & Things is a Rails/Angular App. The idea for Places & Things is to be a lifestyle and travel mazagine/shop. THe site will hightlight places that I've traveled and things that I've bought or coveted while I've been there. 

To launch the site you'll need to do the following:

* Once in the repo - run the following: bundle install, rake db:create, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, and then rails s.
